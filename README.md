# Heart Disease Analysis

This project analyzes heart disease indicators using a dataset and applies decision tree models to predict heart disease presence. It demonstrates data preprocessing, encoding, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Label and one-hot encoding for categorical data.
- Decision Tree classification for heart disease prediction.
- Evaluation using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.
- Exploration of optimal tree depth for better accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset `heartDisease_2020_sampling.csv` includes various health indicators related to heart disease. A sample of the data can be viewed during runtime.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries:
